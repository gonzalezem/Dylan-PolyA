<h4>Metatranscriptomic diversity in Salix roots + rhizophere</h4>
This interactive graphic vizualizes the organism diversity by annotation, as it can be found in the roots + rhizosphere of Salix Fish Creek in hydrocarbons contaminated soil.

Note: DE refers to Differential Expression (including only differentially expressed transcripts). "Full" means all transcripts are considered. Full may run slowly on lower spec computers.
